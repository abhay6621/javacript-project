# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a simple, interactive two-player game built to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as game logic, user interaction, and UI handling. This project is beginner-friendly and suitable for academic submissions, practice projects, or portfolio use.

The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.
